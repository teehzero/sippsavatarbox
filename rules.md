Mods can be reached by pinging @Active Chat Mod
These mods have agreed to directly take DMs for abuse issues:

If a mod is not on this list, do not DM them.


There is room for interpretation in some of these rules. This is by design. Ideally, everyone just acts decently to each other and we don't even have to revisit these. If you accidentally cross a line - hey, it happens - apologize and make it right. For bad actors, though, moderation is at-discretion.

If you're here to make friends and have a good time - welcome! We're glad to have you here!
If you're just here to cause trouble, however, we'll be glad to show you the door.

With that all being said, enjoy your time here!
