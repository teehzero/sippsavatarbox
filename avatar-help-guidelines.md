You will save Helpers time, and get a fix faster if you read and follow these guidelines.
This should take less than ten minutes to read in its entirety. Reference this as often as you need.



__**Before you ask for help:**__
**0.** Search on Google. Search the help archives. Please, don't be a help vampire.
**1.** If your problem is an error, gather as much debug information as you can. (more on debug below)
**2.** Try to narrow down the problem as far as you can. This is often the key part in finding fixes!
**3.** Brush up on terminology. Mixing up similar concepts leads to miscommunication and wasted time.
**4.** Learn to make screenshots. __Please do not take photos of your monitor.__



__**When asking for help:**__
**1.** __Always__ supply the following info:
*a.* Which version of Unity are you using?
*b.* Which version of the SDK are you using?
*c.* When did the problem start? Was it after a version change/upgrade? Was it working before at all? 
*d.* All console errors. Even if they don't seem relevant. (more on debug below)
**2.** Make your problem (and desired outcome) as obvious as possible. We can't know what you don't tell us.
If you need a starting point, try answering some of these (helpful but optional) questions:
*a.* Are you following a tutorial on the topic? Share a link so we can reference it with you.
*b.* What are you trying accomplish? What is stopping you?
*c.* What is the behavior you are expecting? What is happening instead?
*d.* Does the error happen every time?
*e.* What have you already tried?



__**When getting help:**__
**1. Be patient.** - Troubleshooting is by its very nature complex, and requires a lot of back and forth.
**2. Be respectful.** - If a helper is unable to help you, __thank them anyway.__ We're more likely to call reinforcements if you're pleasant.
**3. Be realistic.** - You are here to receive __help__. We will not rig, retexture, or build your avatar for you.
**4. Be reasonable.** - We are, however, willing to help you with the tools to do this work yourself.
**5. Be willing to learn.** - Because of how complex the tools we have to work with are, your help might look like homework.



__**After getting help:**__
**1. Confirm whether or not your problem is solved** - Please don't just ghost us. We're always trying to improve our processes, and this info helps a lot.
**2. Thank your Helpers!** - They went out of their way to help you, despite having no obligation to do so. For free! That's pretty cool!
**3. Don't delete your post** - This will help others with similar issues in the future.
**4. Feel free to stick around!** - If you liked your Helper, there's a good chance you can find them hanging out in #general-chat, too!



__**Debug information**__
1. VRChat debug menu: Action Menu -> Options - > Config -> Debug. Make a screenshot of the __whole__ thing!
2. SDK Errors, including popups and console messages.
3. Unity Error console.
*note:* Error messages can occasionally reveal sensitive information. Always make sure you scrub anything
you don't want to publish to the world before you post. Users with "Active Chat Mod" and "Avatar Helper" roles
can be trusted and may agree to help you with this if you aren't sure. 

*Footnotes*
- We will not provide support for ripped/stolen avatars or other 'illegal' assets.
- Harassing or insulting Helpers is always uncalled for, is not okay, and will __never be tolerated__.
